"* Only vested liabilities are used when determining underfunding for variable-rate premium payment purposes.  Prior to July 1, 1996, the variable-rate premium"				
"    was capped at various levels.  Effective beginning with the 2007 plan year, a cap was imposed on the variable-rate premium for plans of small employers. If all "				
"    contributing sponsors to the plan and their controlled group members have 25 or fewer employees, the per-participant variable-rate premium for that plan will"				
    be capped at $5.00 times the number of participants in the plan.  (The cap for the plan as a whole is effectively $5.00 times the square of the number of plan 				
"    participants.)  Effective beginning with the 2008 plan year, an exemption that allowed some underfunded plans to escape payment of the variable-rate premium"				
      was eliminated and a modification was made to how underfunding is determined for variable-rate premium purposes.				
**  Applies to certain distress or involuntary pension plan terminations that occur after 2005.  For certain airline-related plans that terminate within five years of  				
"       electing to be covered under special funding rules, the annual termination premium (payable for three years) is $2,500 per participant.      "				
"*** Beginning in 2007, this amount is adjusted annually based on changes in the national average wage index (as defined in section 209(k)(1) of the Social"				
   Security Act). The premium rate will not decline even if the national average wage index declines.  The adjusted premium rate is rounded to the nearest				
   multiple of $1.
